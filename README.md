# Rustedbrot

My first program written in Rust. Does that make me a rustacean? Am I rusted enuff?
Anyways, we are generating mandelbrots today. The `src/main.rs` just change the starting point and ending points and width and height and run/build using cargo and you will have an `output.bmp` file in the directory from where you ran the code.
Yes, as easy as that.
